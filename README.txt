Humidity Device
===============

This project explores a fascinating project demonstrating
a simulated device for humidity detection within a room.
Conducted in the TINKERCAD online environment, the project
incorporates essential components such as a breadboard,
Arduino board, LEDs, resistors, a gas sensor, potentiometer,
and an LCD 16x2.

In operation, the device engages in the collection of data
from the air using a simulated gas sensor, emulating the
effects of a water vapor cloud with a specified concentration.
As this virtual cloud is moved closer or farther away, the
LCD dynamically reflects the relative humidity (RH) in the air.
This real-time display serves as a warning, providing users with
insights into whether the air falls within desired parameters.
